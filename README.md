NLP: mining critical features from reviews using TOPIC MODELING
Notebook Overview:
	1.	Setup and Initialization
	•	Includes imports for necessary libraries and environment configuration.
	•	Ensures that dependencies for the project (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy) are properly loaded.
	2.	Data Loading
	•	Scripts to load datasets, including paths for training, validation, and testing data.
	•	Logs dataset statistics like the number of samples, classes, or data distribution.
	3.	Data Preprocessing
	•	Preprocessing pipeline such as image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
	•	Functions to prepare data loaders or batches for model training.
	4.	Model Definition
	•	The architecture of the deep learning model.
	•	Details on layers, activation functions, optimizers, and loss functions.
	5.	Model Training
	•	Training loops or calls to training APIs.
	•	Logs for tracking metrics like accuracy and loss over epochs.
	6.	Model Evaluation and Results
	•	Evaluation on validation or test data with metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
	•	Visualization of results like confusion matrices or sample predictions.
	7.	Outputs
	•	Contains visualizations or printed summaries from the notebook’s execution.

Usage Instructions:
	1.	Prerequisites
	•	Install all required dependencies (e.g., TensorFlow, OpenCV, Pandas).
	•	Prepare the dataset according to the structure expected in the notebook.
	2.	Run the Notebook
	•	Execute cells sequentially to replicate the pipeline.
	•	Check outputs for each stage (e.g., dataset preparation, model training).
	3.	Modify for Custom Use Cases
	•	Update dataset paths or model architecture if applying to a different dataset or task.

Additional Notes:
	•	Ensure GPU support is available for faster training.
	•	Logs or results will vary depending on the dataset and hyperparameters used.
